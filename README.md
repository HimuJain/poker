Hey! Welcome to my first proper project on GitHub!

I was just interested in coding a poker game using C++, the language we're learning right now.

If you'd like to see my plan for the project at the moment, you can refer to planSoFar.md.

It'll be relatively simple at the moment, but as I experiment and figure out more aspects of C++, I'd like to add more features.

Thanks for checking this out!
