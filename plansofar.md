basics of the game (*texas holdem):
1. blind bet/ante (bet first amount)
2. shuffle the cards
3. deal the cards (2 each)
4. deal the "flop" (3 community cards)
5. let the players bet/check/raise
6. repeat 4 and 5 two more times with 1 community card each (2nd stage; turn, 3rd stage; river)

- AI?

**NEW!**:
Learned about objects/structs/classes and vectors, so will be adding features into the game to make it easier
1. card.h for a card class
2. deck.h for a deck class
3. player.h or hand.h for a hand/deck class
4. will use a player or hand vector to store multiple players/hands
